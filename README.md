This is website for a half marathon race that I created.  This will be a place where participants will go to for information on the race.

I used the normalize reset because it was the easiest to understand and read.  There were a lot of comments so that I could understand what was happening.

I could not get my psuedo selector to work correctly.  It was being applied to my entire list (that was not the original plan.) I was also able to apply to apply a link to an image.
